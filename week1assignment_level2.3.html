      <h1><span style = "color: #8866ff;"> Stopping by Woods <br> on a Snowy Evening</span></h1>
      <h3>By Robert Frost </h3>
        <ul style= "list-style-type:circle;">
        <li><p> Whose woods these are I think I know. <br>
        His house is in the village, though; <br>
        He will not see me stopping here <br>
        To watch his woods fill up with snow.</p>

      <ul style= "list-style-type:circle;">
        <li><p>My little horse must think it queer<br>
        To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
        Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
        The darkest evening of the year.</p></li>

      <ul style= "list-style-type:circle;">
        <li><p>He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
        To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
        The only other sound's the weep<br>
        Of easy wind and downy flake.</p></li>

      <ul style= "list-style-type:circle;">
        <li><p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
        But I have promises to keep,<br>
        And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
        And miles to go before I sleep.</p></li>
