              &nbsp;&nbsp; Whose woods these are I think I know. <br>
              His house is in the village, though; <br>
              He will not see me stopping here <br>
              To watch his woods fill up with snow.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;My little horse must think it queer<br>
              To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
              Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
              The darkest evening of the year.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
              To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
              The only other sound's the weep<br>
              Of easy wind and downy flake.

              But I have promises to keep,<br>
              And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
              And miles to go before I sleep.
