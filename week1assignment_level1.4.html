      <h1> Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening </h1>
      <h3> By Robert Frost </h3>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
          His house is in the village, though;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not see me stopping here<br>
          To watch his woods fill up with snow. </p><br>

      <p> My little horse must think it queer<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
        Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkest evening of the year.</p><br>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
        To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other sound's the weep<br>
        Of easy wind and downy flake.</p><br>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
        But I have promises to keep,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
        And miles to go before I sleep. </p><br>
