      <h1> Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening </h1>
      <h3> By Robert Frost </h3>
      <p> Whose woods these are I think I know. <br><br>
          His house is in the village, though; <br>
          He will not see me stopping here <br><br>
          To watch his woods fill up with snow. </p>

      <p> My little horse must think it queer<br><br>
        To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
        Between the woods and frozen lake<br><br>
        The darkest evening of the year.</p>

      <p>He gives his harness bells a shake<br><br>
        To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
        The only other sound's the weep<br><br>
        Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>

      <p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br><br>
        But I have promises to keep,<br>
        And miles to go before I sleep,<br><br>
        And miles to go before I sleep. </p>
