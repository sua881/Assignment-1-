      <h1> Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>
      <h2>By Robert Frost </h2>
      <h4> Whose woods these are I think I know. </h4>
      <p> His house is in the village, though; <br>
          He will not see me stopping here <br>
          To watch his woods fill up with snow. </p>

      <h4> My little horse must think it queer</h4>
      <p>To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
        Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
        The darkest evening of the year.</p>

      <h4>He gives his harness bells a shake</h4>
      <p> To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
        The only other sound's the weep<br>
        Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>

      <h4>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,</h4>
        <p>But I have promises to keep,<br>
        And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
        And miles to go before I sleep. </p>
