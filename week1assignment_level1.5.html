      <h1> Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening </h1>
      <h3> By Robert Frost </h3><br><br>
      <p> Whose woods these are I think I know.
          His house is in the village, though;
          He will not see me stopping here
          To watch his woods fill up with snow. </p><br><br>

      <p> My little horse must think it queer
        To stop without a farmhouse near
        Between the woods and frozen lake
        The darkest evening of the year.</p><br><br>

      <p>He gives his harness bells a shake
        To ask if there is some mistake.
        The only other sound's the weep
        Of easy wind and downy flake.</p><br><br>

      <p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
        But I have promises to keep,
        And miles to go before I sleep,
        And miles to go before I sleep. </p><br><br>
